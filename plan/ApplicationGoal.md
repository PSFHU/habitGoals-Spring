# habitGoals

## Core Concept

<!-- Theres a lot of habbit trackers out there.
Most of them fails to be visual and easy to use. -->
This solution tracks measures instead of a title and cycle based solutions. Measures can be reused to, set new goals on them.
This way results can be put in numbers, and can be displayed in interactive manners.

## Possible problems

- Deleting one MeasureField will, delete multiple used data in SideGoals
- Possible restriction one SideGoal only uses one MeasureField -> Deleting a MeasureField cause multiple SideGoal delete
